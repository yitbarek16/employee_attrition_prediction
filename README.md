# Employee Attrition Prediction - ML

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict employee attrition using HR data. The goal is to identify employees who are likely to leave the organization, supporting data-driven retention strategies.

## Workflow

- Data preprocessing
  - Encode categorical variables
  - Scale numerical features
  - Save cleaned data for reuse
  - Model building
  - Train a Random Forest classifier
    
- Model evaluation
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix visualization

- Model optimization
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

## Results

- Baseline Random Forest accuracy: ~86%
- Optimized model shows improved precision and recall
- Confusion matrices highlight class imbalance challenges

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
